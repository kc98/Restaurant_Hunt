			<h3><strong>Western Food</strong></h3>
			<p>
			Western cuisine is as diverse as oriental food. Even for someone who has 
			not much knowledge in cuisines, Western food is distinguishable from Asian food.
			Aside from the obvious differences, the fastest, but perhaps least accurate, 
			way to set apart Western food is to just look at the fast food menu.
			<br><br>
			Western food is generally considered European or American style cuisine, 
			but to some extent, it also refers to the non-indigenous cuisines of other 
			countries, including Australia. So do not be surprised if people automatically 
			think of burgers, fries, steaks, ribs, and sausages when Western food is mentioned.

		<h3><strong>Asian Food</strong></h3>
		<p>Asian cuisine refers to any of several major regional cuisines, including East Asian, 
		Southeast Asian, South Asian, Central Asian, and Middle Eastern. 
		A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, 
		usually associated with a specific culture. Asia, 
		being the largest and most populous continent, is home to many cultures, 
		many of which have their own characteristic cuisine.
		<br><br>
		Ingredients common to many cultures in the East and Southeast regions of the 
		continent include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, 
		soy, and tofu. Stir frying, steaming, and deep frying are common cooking methods.</p>

			<h3><strong>Japanese Food</strong></h3>
			<p><br>
			It is often mentioned in connection with a healthy diet because of the 
			large amount of fish and vegetables eaten. Even in Japanese home-style cooking, a 
			lot of fresh, seasonal fish and vegetables are cooked and people enjoy the natural 
			cycle of the seasons.
			<br><br>
			The most important staple food in Japan is rice, which is eaten at almost every meal. 
			There are many different types of rice dishes, plain, boiled white rice is excellent 
			for enhancing both main and side dishes in Japanese, Chinese or European cuisine. 
			<br><br>
			In Japanese cuisine great attention is attached to fresh ingredients, 
			gentle methods of cooking and authentic flavours. Many Japanese foods are 
			only cooked for a very short time or are even eaten raw. Dashi is a basic soup 
			stock and essential for any Japanese dishes in order to provide the necessary taste 
			and moreover enhance the flavours. 
			<br><br>
			Soy sauce and other Japanese seasonings are also used to enhance the intrinsic 
			flavour of food - the combination of sushi and soy sauce is a good example.

		<h3><strong>Theme Restaurant</strong></h3>
		<p>Theme restaurants are restaurants in which the concept of the restaurant 
		takes priority over everything else, influencing the architecture, food, music, 
		and overall 'feel' of the restaurant. The food usually takes a backseat to the 
		presentation of the theme, and these restaurants attract customers solely on the 
		premise of the theme itself.
		<br><br>
		It also offers a unique dining experience. Incorporating the theme 
		into the decor, music, staff outfits and food is essential. But it is equally 
		essential to keep sight of what people ultimately go to restaurants for: eating. 
		The most successful theme restaurants will provide a unique dining experience 
		through both entertainment and quality food.</p>
